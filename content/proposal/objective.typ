  *Proposal Objective*
  - What are the main goals of your thesis? 
  - This section should start with a short overview where you state the goals (using action-oriented phrasing) with short enumerated bulletpoints, i.e. 1., 2., 3., ...
  - Do not use the gerund form for verbs, e.g. instead of "Developing Feature XYZ", write "Develop Feature XYZ", and make sure to provide concrete goals, not generic ones
  - Then, the section has a sub section for each goal (repeating the enumerated bulletpoint before to stay consistent) which is at least two paragraphs long and describes the goal in more detail. Again be specific
