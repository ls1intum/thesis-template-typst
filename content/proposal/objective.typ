  *Proposal Objective*
  - Define the main goals of your thesis clearly and concisely.
  - Start with a short overview where you enumerate the goals as bullet points, using action-oriented phrasing (e.g., 1., 2., 3., ...).
  - Avoid the gerund form for verbs (e.g., "Developing Feature XYZ") and noun phrases (e.g., "Feature XYZ Development"). Instead, use action-oriented language such as "Develop Feature XYZ", similar to how you would formulate use cases in UML use case diagrams.
  - Ensure your goals are concrete and specific, avoiding generic statements. Clearly state what you aim to achieve.
  - Expand on each goal in a dedicated subsection. Repeat the corresponding enumerated bullet point number to maintain consistency and provide at least two paragraphs explaining the goal. Focus on being precise and specific in your descriptions.
