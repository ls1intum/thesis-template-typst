  - What are the main goals of your thesis? 
  - Ideally this section starts with a short overview where you state the goals with short enumerated bulletpoints, i.e. 1., 2., 3., ...
  - Then, the section has a sub section for each goal (repeating the bulletpoint before to stay consistent) which is at least two paragraphs long and describes the goal in more detail
