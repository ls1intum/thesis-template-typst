= Introduction

#rect(

Artemis is a teaching platform that allows instructors and tutors to publish exercises to students, e.g., programming exercises.
Students create solutions by iteratively applying techniques of version control and continuous integration
#cite("10.1145/3159450.3159602").
Artemis not only supports programming exercises, but modeling-, quiz-, text-, and file upload exercises, as well as, an exam mode.
The exercises help students learn the teaching material hands-on and keep them involved in the lecture.
Interactive learning is a teaching philosophy, where students are at the center of a repeated cycle.
In one iteration, the students follow five steps: Theory, example, practice, feedback, and reflection
#cite("krusche2021IL").

Mobile applications enable students to practice interactive learning, alongside laptops and tablets
#cite("10.1145/3159450.3159602").
Until recently, Artemis revolved around the Artemis application, namely a server program and a web client.
The Artemis project gained two native mobile applications, one Android client and one iOS client
#footnote[https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/blob/develop/docs/user/mobile-applications.rst].
The mobile applications do not support the same features and they do not support all the web client's features.
